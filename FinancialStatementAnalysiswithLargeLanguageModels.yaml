extraction:
  task: Triple # task type, chosen from Base, NER, RE, EE, Triple
  # instruction: >
  #   Extract only causal factual triples directly supported by the text. 
  #   A valid triple must describe a real cause → effect relationship explicitly stated in the text using terms such as "causes," "leads to," "results in," "because," "increases," "reduces," or other clear causal phrasing.

  #   Do not generate triples that are not grounded in the text. 
  #   Do not infer, imagine, or hallucinate causal links.
  #   Do not include abstract concepts like "probability," "chain-of-thought," or model internal behavior.
  #   Do not include analysis of GPT, LLMs, or the extraction system itself.

  #   Use the exact wording from the input text for head, relation, and tail whenever possible.
  #   Output each causal statement as a separate triple. 
  #   Ensure head and tail are not identical and contain no empty values.

  #   Only output triples in the JSON format required by the schema:
  #   {
  #     "head": "",
  #     "head_type": "",
  #     "relation": "",
  #     "relation_type": "",
  #     "tail": "",
  #     "tail_type": ""
  #   }
  #   For example:
  #   {
  #     "head": "Poor sleep",
  #     "head_type": "Noun",
  #     "relation": "Reduces",
  #     "relation_type": "Verb",
  #     "tail": "cognitive performance",
  #     "tail_type": "Noun"
  #   }
